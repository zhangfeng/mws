# mws
Music WorkStation with CLI only

This MWS project propose a solution to *build* pieces of music within
text-console.

# Why another Music Studio?

This project try to fill the gap of making music just with a CLI-only app.

Hope this project will be useful for others

# Philosophy

At the beginning, I was thinking to make a front-end for the awesome
`ecasound` app. In the same time, I realized that I would maybe prefer to
use `sox`. After a while, one of my friend introduced `gstreamer` to me...

Finally, I change my mind and choose to develop a front-end for all of
them. The idea is to use installed MAO sofrware and used what I think the
best way.
